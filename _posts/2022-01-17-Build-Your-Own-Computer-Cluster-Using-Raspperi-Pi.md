Have a computer cluster around your hands is a good thing if you want to hacking something fun. You can 
experiment your new ideas, do some distribute computing experiment, learning how to do network configuration.
The most important, you have the control feeling from the peace mind. Yes! All that is the destination of
a hacking soul. In this article, we will travel along the road to build a *Raspberry-Pi* cluster, let's go!

# 1. Hadware prepare:
* Four *Raspberry-Pi* 4B(4GB) -- $120 * 4
* Four SDHC card(32GB) -- $5 * 4
* Four 12-inch Cat.6 Ethenet cables -- $1 * 4
* Four 12-inch USB A-Micro USB cables -- $1 * 4
* One 5-port 10/100 Fast Ethenet switch(with charger) -- $12
* One 5-port USB charger
* One *Raspberry-Pi* stackble case capable of holding 4 Pis -- $10

Use your toolset, construct out the cluster:
