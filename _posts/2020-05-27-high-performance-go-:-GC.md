# Go GC
Go is a GC language, this is the design principle and never change. We want
to know how our program use memory, and when GC performance is the bottleneck,
how we deal with it.
## 1. GC world view and design change
GC will give the program an illusion, that it may have infinite amount of memory
available to use. And over the time, Go GC has moved from a pure *stop the world*
collector to a concurrent, non compacting collector. And the big picture is that
--Go GC favors *low_latency* over *maximum_throughput*.

The time line of Go GC design change:
+ Go 1.0, stop the world mark sweep collector based heavily on tcmalloc.
+ Go 1.3, fully precise collector, wouldnâ€™t mistake big numbers on the heap 
  for pointers, thus leaking memory.
+ Go 1.5, new GC design, focusing on latency over throughput.
+ Go 1.6, GC improvements, handling larger heaps with lower latency.
+ Go 1.7, small GC improvements, mainly refactoring.
+ Go 1.8, further work to reduce STW times, now down to the 100 microsecond range.
+ Go 1.10+, move away from pure cooprerative goroutine scheduling to lower the 
  latency when triggering a full GC cycle.
+ Go 1.13 Scavenger rewritten
## 2. Tune GC
There is a environment variable GOGC, and the formula for GOGC is:

![gc formula](/assets/gc/gc_formula.png)

Fig 1. GOGC formula

For example, we have 256MB heap, and GOGC = 50; when heap size grow bigger than:
256MB * 1.5 = 384MB, the GC will start to work. We can conclude:
+ when GOGC is big, the pressure of GC is small.
+ when GOGC is small, the pressure of GC is big.

## 3. How to monitoring the GC
### 3.1 use *GODEBUG=gctrace=1*
A simple way is to enable the output of GC logging, by setting the GODEBUG envir
 -onment variable.

 ``` bash
 $env GODEBUG=gctrace=1 godoc -http=:8080 -goroot /usr/lib/go-1.14
 ``` 

The privious command set gctrace on when running *godoc* program. The GC logging
 is:

 Fig 2. GC logging

 Search document of runtime package get:
 gc # @#s #%: #+#+# ms clock, #+#/#/#+# ms cpu, #->#-># MB, # MB goal, # P
 where the fields are as follows:
 + gc #        the GC number, incremented at each GC
 + @#s         time in seconds since program start
 + #%          percentage of time spent in GC since program start
 + #+...+#     wall-clock/CPU times for the phases of the GC
 + #->#-># MB  heap size at GC start, at GC end, and live heap
 + # MB goal   goal heap size
 + # P         number of processors used

 When you know your program has a GC problem, use *GODEBUG=gctrace=1* is a good
 way, but for general telemetry the "net/http/pprof" is much useful.
### 3.2 use *net/http/pprof*
We use a simple program to demonstrate how to use *net/http/pprof*, and why it 
is a *holy grail* to monitor your online program:

``` go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	_ "net/http/pprof"
)

func main() {
	ip := "0.0.0.0:6060"
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(ip, nil); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("start pprof failed on %s\n", ip)
	}
}
``` 

``` bash
$go run test_gc.go
``` 

Running the program, and open a http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/ in your
favourite web browser. you will get a window like this:

![net/http/pprof page](/assets/gc/gc_http_pprof.png)

Fig 3. net/http/pprof web page

Use command line get profile message:
+ download cpu profile:
  - go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile                 # 30-second CPU profile
  - go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=120     # wait 120s
+ download heap profile:
  - go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap      
+ download goroutine profile:
  - go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine 
+ download block profile:
  - go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/block     
+ download mutex profile
  - go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/mutex 
  
## 4. Tech to minimise memory allocation
+ *string*s vs *[]byte*s
Avoid *[]byte* and string conversions whenever possible. But why?
In Go []byte is mutable, string is immutable. Most programs prefer
to work with string, but most IO is done with []byte. when you really
want to convert []byte to string, use *slicebytetostringtmp* in
runtime/string.h.
+  using *[]byte* as map key
+  avoid string concatenation
+  don't force allocations on the caller of your API
+  preallocate slices if the length is known
Append pattern can copy a lot of data and creating a lot of garbage.
+  reuse common objects using sync.Pool
+  be careful about padding and alignment of struct

I don't want talk too much about the detail tech to minimise memory allocation,
so it's up to you to dig into the big world:), good luck!!!
